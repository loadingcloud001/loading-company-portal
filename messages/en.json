Our IoT solutions — including smart helmets, environmental sensors, AI surveillance, and access control — are designed and tested to fully comply with these standards, ensuring your site meets all regulatory requirements.",
    "faq2Q": "Where do you source your IoT hardware?",
    "faq2A": "We partner with leading global IoT manufacturers and source certified, industrial-grade hardware that meets international safety and quality standards. All devices are rigorously tested for Hong Kong's construction site conditions, including high humidity, dust, and extreme temperatures.",
    "faq3Q": "How long does a typical installation take?",
    "faq3A": "A standard single-site deployment can be completed in 1–2 weeks, depending on the scope and number of systems required. This includes hardware installation, software configuration, network setup, and on-site testing. Multi-site or large-scale deployments are planned on a project-by-project basis.",
    "faq4Q": "Can you develop custom software for our specific requirements?",
    "faq4A": "Absolutely. We offer custom software development services including real-time monitoring dashboards, mobile apps, data analytics platforms, and integration with your existing enterprise systems. Our development team works closely with you to tailor solutions that match your exact operational needs."
